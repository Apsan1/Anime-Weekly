With the internet and various streaming site, watching anime has become a trend in Nepal. The craze for anime has given birth to the only existing official anime fan club in Nepal: Otaku Club Nepal.

In Nepal, anime has created such influence, that there are several stores dedicated to anime cultures. There are events and conferences organized strictly dedicated to anime. We have an annual anime carnival called Otaku Jatra which showcases cosplaying, video games, foods and drinks, and anime culture.

According to the coordinator of convention Abhinav Das Shrestha, Otaku Jatra is an annual event involving comic and pop culture in Nepal. It is hosted by Otaku Club Nepal. “The event is combined for a die-hard fan of anime, DC/Marvel or pop culture related, gaming, skating, and YouTubers. The objective behind organizing the event is to create a platform for these fanatics,” Shrestha said.
<p>He added, “This is the third edition and we are trying to go big.  We are going to the mass this time to create a platform for anyone who is extremely passionate about anything. That’s why we have chosen Bhrikutimandp hall for this edition.”</p>
